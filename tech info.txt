QRB 1134 Sensors:

Max emitter current = 50ma
We want to go at 40ma for safety

Ideal distance is probably around 140 mils, but we can push it to 200,
by 250 mils we are at 65% efficiency.

Rise/fall time is 8us
Note, if we are saturating, we want to wait longer

Max current source/sink on an IO pin is 4/12 ma

Emitter resitors
5V numbers
 = 90 ohms = (5-1.4)/.04)
3.3V numbesr
 = 50 ohms

Jake's choice = 100 ohms, nice and simple

Voltage generating resitors:
Smaller value of Rl is faster response time, but less accurate

If we want to get 3.3V on the output, which is the max unless we provide a vref:

3.3/(.6/1000) = 5500 ohm

Hardware Todo:
 - Investigate a system to change sensor vertical height dynmically

Electronics Todo:
 - Clean Main Voltage to 3.3 V supply with huge caps and some good filtering
 - Easy to access motor control signal connecitons
 - Wire a main board, needs PIC socket, sensor+button input with MC output, can be on same board as supply

Software Todo:
 - Line center + width algo
 - Divergance detection and tracking
 - Course end detection
